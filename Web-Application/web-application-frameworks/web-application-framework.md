# Web Application Framework

An application framework designed to support development of web applications that generally includes:

- Database support
- templating framework for generating dynamic web content
- HTTP session management and middleware support
- Built-in testing framework

The point is that the cost per request is plummeting, but the cost of programming is not. Thus, we have to find ways to trade efficiency in the runtime for efficiency in the 'thought time' in order to make the development of applications cheaper. I believed we've long since entered an age where simplicity of development and maintenance is where the real value lies. 

### Popular Web Application Frameworks
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- Play (Java and Scala)
- ASP.NET MVC (Microsoft)
- Django (Python)
- Sinatra (Ruby)
- Symfony (PHP)
- Sails.js (Node.js, JavaScript)

Note: WordPress, Drupal and Joomla! are content management systems (CMSs), not web application frameworks.
