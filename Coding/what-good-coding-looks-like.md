# What Good Coding Looks Like

### Good code has the following properties:
	- **Correct** : operate correctly on all expected and unexpected inputs.
	- **Efficient** : operate as efficiently as possible in terms of both time and space.
	- **Simple** : if you can do someting in 10 lines instead of 100, you should.
	- **Readable** : A different developer should be able to read and understand your code. Comments are necessary, also the code implements things in an easily understandable way. 
	- **Maintainable** : Code should be reasonably adaptable to changes during the life cycle of a product and should be easy to maintain by other developers, as well as the initial developer.

### Tips
	- Design your own data structure when it is necessary and optimal.
	- Appropriate code reuse
	- Writing modular code: separating isolated chunks of code out into their own methods. This help the code more maintaniable, readable and testable.
