### underfitting vs. overfitting
- Overfitting and under-fitting are the two biggest causes for poor performances of machine learning algorithms. 

- Under-fitting refers to a machine learning model that can neither model the training data or generalise to the testing data. an under-fitting machine learning model is not a suitable model,  undercutting is often not discussed as it is easy to detect given a good performance metric, such as accuracy, precision and recall.

- Overfitting happens when a model learns the details and noise in the training data too well, too well that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on the testing data.  To balance overfitting, we can go for simpler machine learning model with fewer parameters to tune. Another important thing is to do cross validation, splitting the dataset in balance.
