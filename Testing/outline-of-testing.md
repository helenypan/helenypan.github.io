# Outline of Testing

### 4 Types of Testing
- testing a real world object
- testing a piece of software
- testing a function
- troubleshooting questions

### Testing a Real World Object Workflow
1. who will use it and why
2. what are the use cases
3. what are the bounds of use
4. what are the stress/failure conditions
5. how would you perform the test

### Testing a Piece of Software Workflow
1. Are we doing black box testing or white box testing
2. who will use it and why
3. what are the use cases for different type of users
4. what are the bounds of use
5. what are the stress/failure conditions
6. Further define test cases and discuss how to perform the testing
	- define the test cases in a structural manner, break down into the main components and go down 
	- while automation allow you to do some very powerful testing, it also has some significant drawbacks
	- Manual testing should usually be part of your test procedures

### Testing a Function Workflow
1. Define the test cases
	- Normal cases
	- extremes
	- Nulls and illegal input
	- strange input
2. define the expected result
3. write the test code

### Troubleshooting
1. Understand the scenario, ask questions to unstand as much as the situation as possible
2. Breakdown the problem into testable units, list the flow of the situation, at some point in this process, e.g. something fails and causes the crash
3. create specific and manageable tests
